<h1>Black Soldiering in Africa and the Caribbean</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Black soldiers. Black allies. Black peoples. Some peaceful, some resisting but oftentimes they were put under a general umbrella with little nuance for their separate cultures and them as individuals, even after “proving” themselves to their colonizers many were still regarded with suspicion and as lesser beings, as seen in many instances of colonization and post-colonization. Slavery was a product of this perspective and effort, used to enforce and substantiate colonial and racial control, yet there are many ways in which Black peoples created customs and crafted perspectives to resist the idea of racial superiority and discrimination, establishing their own cultures through religion and solidarity. One aspect of this site specifically looks into the treatment of Black allies and soldiers during the initial colonization efforts in Africa and within the slave trade culture of the Carribean (West Indies), and in particular how treatment of soldiers evolved in Jamaica, exploring the enslaved West Indies regiments, the Crimean War, and the Great War.</p>

<p>We wish to give voice to those soldiers and peoples who were oppressed and attacked without provocation or with little effort on the part of the colonizers to understand their traditions and how it informed their lives. With this intent, we utilize an autobiography and a historical account by authors of Black Jamaican origin. We also pull from scholarly articles and British periodicals as unfortunately little has been made digitally accessible from the perspective of the colonized, but within the project will talk about the limitations and biases that are conveyed by these sources and compare them to the experiences and perspectives of Black Africa and Black Jamaica.

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>Mission Statement:
As digital project designers and consumers, we value the ability to be critically aware of what we are perceiving. Therefore, in an effort to encourage this skill while also being transparent about the biases of our work, we have built into this project a framework of discussing these limitations and how they can affect the understanding of a topic as well as why we still chose to convey information in a particular way or used a certain source. This examination of the mechanisms behind the project also extends to any digital platform we may use as we believe it is important to know the history of a tool so that a user may choose whether to support it or not.</p>

<p>We are also firm proponents of accessibility and wish to engage the general public with the content that we provide as much of it is often placed in academic lockboxes--not just in its location but in the language used. Therefore, we make efforts to be engaging, navigable, and accessible for anyone viewing the site. We acknowledge that often these digital projects though accessible as digital gateways are not often accessible in the way that there is an awareness of it outside academia. With this in mind, we have created social media accounts in which we will be regularly post engaging content and outreaching ourselves to non-academic communities. On the subject of minimal computing and making sure all devices can efficiently load and explore the site, we will design the project so that it is workable by lower functioning devices while balancing the needs and purposes of the project.</p>

<p>The overall intent of this project is to examine how Black people in Africa and the Caribbean (particularly Jamaica) were treated by colonizers in times of war and tension and examine the psychological and cultural effects. One significant theme is the discrimination of Black allies and soldiers by white colonizers. We wish to give a voice to those peoples, but we also know that as we are not them, there are many challenges in lifting their experiences and perspectives high accurately. We can never truly understand where they are coming from, but that does not mean that it is not worth it to try. As working with collaborators is beyond the scope of the project, we have searched for primary sources to help us form an idea of what Black people in particular times and situations encountered. However, we wish to note that our sampling of sources is small and demonstrate the views of a few people and in no way spans the total experience of colonial and post-colonial times in Black Africa and Black Jamaica. In addition, though we wish to focus on Black primary sources and in this way highlight their voices, unfortunately little has been made digitally accessible from the perspective of the colonized. To help fill in gaps, we have also pulled from scholarly articles and British periodicals but instead of using them as main content pieces will instead frame them beside our primary sources to compare differences and similarities as well as using it as a tool to demonstrate biases that can occur in such mediums.</p>
